# License?
License for the code I made doesn't have any. Do whatever you want with it, however I am not responsible for any damages.  
The icons in the corner image are GPLv2 (linked above).  
I assume the code I forked from has no license either, since it didn't come with any.

# Documented issues with fixes
**I log in and it goes straight back to xdm. Why???**  
Have you created a .xsession file in your home directory? Also make sure you do chmod 755 on Xstartup.

# What resolutions are this theme tested on?
640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1440x900, 1600x900, 1920x1080. It should Just Workâ„¢ on every resolution above 640x480.
